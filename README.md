# Coding-Interviews

## IMPORTANT PREFACE--
Alot of this work is highly outdated and I am not keeping it up to date. I haven't pushed to this repo in about two years and I was arguably not a very good scientist when I started this project. If you are looking for programming best practice, my old code is not where you will find it :) 


Since I'm doing a lot of technical tasks for data science, here's some of the tasks I am allowed to share


Currently finished tasks - 

Word2Vec corpus similarity engine
Houseprice regression modelling- Deep learning and tree methods
Fraud detection- imbalanced classification with tree methods

Currently on the todo- 

Working on a Named Entity Normalisation Engine
Some Apache Server log querying work using only standard libary
